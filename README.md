  ## Description
  The motivation for this project was to build a functional application that could be used throughout the journey of a bootcamp student. It works as a time saver since the README is generated automatically as it only asks for user input.

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository. Open up the terminal and input the command npm install, in order to install all necessary packages. Then do the command "node index.js" in order to start the prompts.

  ## Usage
  For example after doing the "node index.js" command it will ask for the project title, just input the name and the prompts will guide you through any information you should need to input.
